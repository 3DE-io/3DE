Project Goals
------------

With a myriad of editors out there (jsfiddle, jsbin, codepen, etc), how does _dflux_ differ?

* A tool, not (just) a toy
* Integrate into your existing development environment
* Centered on components
  * Based on templating engine/framework of your choice
  * Simplify using components
  * Includes data as a first-class asset
* Testing for template outputs
